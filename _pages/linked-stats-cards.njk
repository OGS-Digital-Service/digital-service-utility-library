<p> From the day Governor Hochul took office, her commitment to every New Yorker has been simple: “your family is my fight." In her inaugural address, she laid out a clear vision: make New York more affordable, safer, and fairer for every family. She pledged to take on the state’s toughest challenges head-on and invest in what makes New York, New York. Over four years later, Governor Hochul has delivered on that promise, putting money back in New Yorkers' pockets, keeping communities safe, defending fundamental rights from Washington's attacks, and fighting for hardworking families. And she’s just getting started. </p>
