        bio:"
        I enjoy taking apart tech problems and reassembling the parts into functional stuff that real humans can use. I'm a strong advocate of usable and accessible design first and fancy complex frameworks last. I believe that the web should be open and inclusive and promote the free and fair sharing of information. I am still fascinated by HTML and that people can just <em> make </em> websites. I'm passionate about digital accessibility and making positive change in the world through technology.
