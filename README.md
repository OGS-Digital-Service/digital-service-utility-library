## Opinions
1. Eleventy for static site generation and general stack management.
2. Utility-first css for basic layout (we pulled syntax and basic helpers from tailwindcss) 
3. Trunk-based Development Process
4. Nunjucks as a templating language.
5. as little js as possible in production.
6. Alpinejs instead of any other helper js libraries or frameworks.

## What browsers do we support?

## What do we not support?
- ![IE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Internet%20Explorer-0076D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=Internet%20Explorer&logoColor=white) There's some really minor fallbacks for basic stuff like background color. 
- ![Opera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Opera-FF1B2D?style=for-the-badge&logo=Opera&logoColor=white) before it was chromium.
