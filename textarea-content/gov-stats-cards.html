<p> From the day Governor Hochul took office, her commitment to every New Yorker has been simple: “your family is my fight." In her inaugural address, she laid out a clear vision: make New York more affordable, safer, and fairer for every family. She pledged to take on the state’s toughest challenges head-on and invest in what makes New York, New York.

And she’s just getting started. </p>
